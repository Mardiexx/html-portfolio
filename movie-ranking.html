<h1> The best movies according to Mardiyyah</h1>
 <h2> My top three movies of all time </h2> <hr />
 <h3> Someone Great </h3>
 <p></p>It's one of those flat-lined movies it doesn't have ups and downs moments it just ends with the same pace that it started with, if you go in expecting some kind of a powerful message I would suggest you tone down your expectations. it's not bad it's just not great, i enjoyed the diversity and the sense of friendship that it had but that's about it.</p>
 <p> I laughed and cried and celebrated their friendship with these ladies. Acting was good and no, I don't think it felt forced. I only wish there was more comedy or more backstory on the two friends of the main character. I really like this in the frame of his romcoms are evolving. While it's not for everyone, I really think we need more like this. More romcoms- for this age group and for older, too. (I'm especially needing this as therapy for the current political climate!) PS the scene with singing and dancing to Lizzo was the best- but too short!!!</p>
 <h3> The Vampire Diaries</h3>
 <p> This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)</p>
 <h3>The Notebook</h3>
 <p> I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.

    This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie.
    
    The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie.
    
    As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical "boy loves girl" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre.
    
    The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the "rich man" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many "cliches" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie.
    
    It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time.
    
    The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch.</p>
